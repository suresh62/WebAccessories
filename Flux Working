1. A user does some html actions like click,select etc.We trigger action for that event.
2. We call a Action function from that event.We pass necessary values like user select value,or any data attributes.
3. In Action the called function dispatches an event.It also passes the value along with the dispatch params.
4. Now every component which has subscribered to the dispatched event will get triggered.
5. In the function we can call the render function of the react to update the view.We can use forceUpdate also.
6. In render function we will the store function to get the latest values.

We can update the store values also the function which we call when trigger happens.

component (htm actions click,select,pass value along) => call action function => action function dispatches the event => 
all the registered function are called(we can update store,update view etc)
